Welcome to Multiple Linear Regression.
This project builds a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of car prices.
A Chinese automobile company wants to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

-> Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car.
-> How well those variables describe the price of a car.
